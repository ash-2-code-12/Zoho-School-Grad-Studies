1. **Iterate Through a Queue**:
Create a Java program that initializes a `Queue` of strings with the values {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"}. Use an iterator to print each element in the queue.
2. **PriorityQueue Operations**:
Write a Java program that creates a `PriorityQueue` of integers. Add the numbers 5, 1, 3, 2, and 4 to the queue. Print the head of the queue using the `peek` method, then remove the head and print the entire queue to show the new order.
3. Simulate a CPU job scheduling system where arriving jobs (objects with processing time) are added to a queue. The CPU dequeues and processes jobs one at a time, tracking waiting and turnaround times. You can introduce priorities or time slicing for fairer scheduling.
