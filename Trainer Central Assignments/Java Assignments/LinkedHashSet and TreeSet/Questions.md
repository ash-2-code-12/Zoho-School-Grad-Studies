1. **Basic LinkedHashSet Operations**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedHashSet` of integers. Add the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 to the set. Attempt to add the number 15 again. Print all elements in the set and observe the order and duplicates.
2. **Remove Elements from LinkedHashSet**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedHashSet` of characters with the values {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'}. Remove the character 'C' from the set. Check if 'C' is still in the set and print the resulting set.
3. **Convert LinkedHashSet to Array and Vice Versa**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedHashSet` of strings with the values {"red", "green", "blue", "yellow"}. Convert the set to an array and print the array. Then, convert the array back to a `LinkedHashSet` and print the resulting set.

1. **Basic TreeSet Operations**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `TreeSet` of integers. Add the numbers 50, 30, 20, 10, and 40 to the set. Print all elements in the set and observe the order.
2. **TreeSet with Custom Comparator**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `TreeSet` of strings with a custom comparator that orders strings by their length. Add the strings {"banana", "apple", "cherry", "date"} to the set. Print the elements to verify the custom ordering.
3. **TreeSet Methods: first(), last(), higher(), and lower()**:
   Write a Java program that creates a `TreeSet` of doubles with the values {1.1, 2.2, 3.3, 4.4, 5.5}. Use the `first()`, `last()`, `higher()`, and `lower()` methods to retrieve and print the first element, last element, the smallest element strictly greater than 3.3, and the largest element strictly less than 3.3.
