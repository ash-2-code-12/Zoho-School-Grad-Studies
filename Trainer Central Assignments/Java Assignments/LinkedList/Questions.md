1. Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of integers. Add the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 to the list. Retrieve and print the first and last elements in the list.
2. Create a Java program that initializes a `LinkedList` of strings with the values {"one", "two", "three", "four", "five"}. Use a `ListIterator` to iterate through the list and replace every occurrence of the word "three" with "THREE". Print the modified list.
3. Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of integers. Add the numbers 1 to 10 to the list. Then, remove the third element (index 2) and the last element from the list. Print the resulting list.
4. Write a Java program that creates a `LinkedList` of characters with the values {'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'}. Write a method to reverse the linked list and print the reversed list.
